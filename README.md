Hello, I'm Luke Thrower and I'm currently working my through freeCodecamps resources in order to improve my data and programming skills.

Currently the focus has been on SQL and Bash, with a view to moving onto Python in the future.

The repo's here are a way of me tracking my progress and eventually building up a portfolio of projects.
